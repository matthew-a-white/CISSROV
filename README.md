# CISSROV

This github repository is for the Concordia Shanghai High School ROV robotics team to host all of the code written for the 2016 competition.


Updates needed:
* Fix issue with motors not responding quickly to logitech controllers.
* If possible, move code over to Teensy to save space and allow for depth/pressure data to be easily displayed on the http server.
